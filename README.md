# WireMock.Net
A C# .NET version based on [mock4net](https://github.com/alexvictoor/mock4net) which mimics the functionality from the JAVA based [WireMock.org](http://WireMock.org).

## Key Features
* HTTP response stubbing, matchable on URL/Path, headers, cookies and body content patterns
* Runs in unit tests, as a standalone process, as windows service, as Azure or IIS or as docker
* Configurable via a fluent DotNet API, JSON files and JSON over HTTP
* Record/playback of stubs
* Per-request conditional proxying
* Stateful behaviour simulation
* Configurable response delays

### Build info
To build you need:
- Microsoft .NET Framework [4.5.1 Developer Pack](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40772)
- Microsoft .NET Framework [4.5.2 Developer Pack](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=42637)

- .NET Core 2.0 (https://www.microsoft.com/net/download)

## Stubbing
A core feature of WireMock.Net is the ability to return canned/predefined HTTP responses for requests matching criteria, see [Wiki : Stubbing & Request Matching](https://github.com/WireMock-Net/WireMock.Net/wiki/Stubbing-and-Request-Matching).

## Admin API Reference
The WireMock admin API provides functionality to define the mappings via a http interface, see [Wiki : Admin API Reference](https://github.com/StefH/WireMock.Net/wiki/Admin-API-Reference).

## Using
WireMock.Net can be used in several ways:

### UnitTesting
You can use your favorite test framework and use WireMock within your tests, see
[Wiki : UnitTesting](https://github.com/StefH/WireMock.Net/wiki/Using-WireMock-in-UnitTests).

### As standalone process / console application
This is quite straight forward to launch a mock server within a console application, see [Wiki : Standalone Process](https://github.com/StefH/WireMock.Net/wiki/WireMock-as-a-standalone-process).

### As a Windows Service
You can also run WireMock.Net as a Windows Service, follow this [WireMock-as-a-Windows-Service](https://github.com/WireMock-Net/WireMock.Net/wiki/WireMock-as-a-Windows-Service).

### As a Web Job in Azure or application in IIS
See this link [WireMock-as-a-(Azure)-Web-App](https://github.com/WireMock-Net/WireMock.Net/wiki/WireMock-as-a-(Azure)-Web-App)

### In a docker container
There is also a Linux and Windows-Nano container available at [hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com/r/sheyenrath).
For more details see also [Docker](https://github.com/WireMock-Net/WireMock.Net-docker).

#### HTTPS / SSL
More details on using HTTPS (SSL) can be found here [Wiki : HTTPS](https://github.com/WireMock-Net/WireMock.Net/wiki/Using-HTTPS-(SSL))
